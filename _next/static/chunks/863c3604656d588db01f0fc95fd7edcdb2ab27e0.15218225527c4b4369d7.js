As the world around us becomes more technologically advanced, influencer marketing has made its way to the forefront and companies are devoting more time and effort to the tactic than ever before. As a digital agency that is constantly looking for ways to give our clients an advantage, we recommend and implement influencer marketing as part of a cohesive digital marketing plan to help get brands on the map. More and more, we are seeing our clients shift focus to influencer marketing to propel their brand through social media.<br/><br/><b>What Is Influencer Marketing?</b><br/><br/>Influencer marketing is a relationship between a brand and an influencer. The influencer promotes the brand\'s products or services through various media outlets such as Instagram and YouTube. Not to be confused with celebrity endorsements, influencer marketing does more than just attach a well-known celebrity to a brand. Influencers must be trusted figures within a niche community and retain a loyal following. In addition, they typically possess knowledge or experience about what they are advertising.<br/><br/>For example, a popular fitness vlogger on YouTube with extensive knowledge in weight training and proper nutrition may be asked to do advertising for sportswear or a supplement company. On occasion, an influencer may not have experience relevant to the product they are advertising. In this situation, they rely on the trust and loyalty they have built within their community to influence their followers. Common influencer categories include adventurists, photographers, food enthusiasts, how-to experts, beauticians, artists, models and comedians to name a few. <br/><br/>Influencers operate independently, creating their own content and integrating a company\u2019s advertising specifications into it. The influencer is in control of the brand\'s message, choosing how they would like to portray it. This promotes authenticity and can help reach a specific target audience. The monetary value of an influencer is typically calculated by the size of their social following as well as the platform they are using. On Instagram, industry experts suggest a price point of $1,000 per 100,000 followers. This price should be adjusted further depending on the reach and relevance of your influencer. On YouTube, a price point of $100 per 1,000 views is standard. The beauty of influencer marketing is that anyone can become an influencer, and businesses have a plethora to choose from, allowing them to reach large target audiences.<br/><br/><b>Why Is Influencer Marketing So Important?</b><br/><br/>Not long before technological advancements, scheduled television was virtually the only mass media consumers had access to and was one of the main platforms marketers used to advertise to the masses. Today, with the creation of the internet and the popularity of social media platforms like Instagram, Facebook and YouTube, consumers have unlimited freedom and choice over the content they wish to view. This creates a problem for brands. As their target audience continues to spread out over various forms of media, it becomes increasingly difficult to reach them.<br/><br/>As a result, marketers discovered that influencer marketing could offer a solution to the problem. It allows brands to locate and advertise directly to their target audience. Consumers are becoming increasingly skeptical of brands and their marketing tactics, and building trust is crucial. Advertising through influencers allows brands to promote through someone that a niche community watches, engages with and trusts on a daily basis. So, instead of being skeptical of a commercial or social media ad, consumers are trusting that if their influencer of choice loves the product, they will too.<br/><br/><b>What To Look Out For</b><br/><br/>Unlike most marketing strategies, influencer marketing requires a high level of trust between a brand and a third party. Although influencers are often required to sign lawful contracts, the care of the brand\'s reputation is essentially in their keeping. A brand must be sure the influencer\u2019s content aligns with their overall image. The use of uncanny or offensive content could have negative consequences on the brand\'s reputation. This is especially important when working with young influencers who may lack maturity and professionalism.<br/><br/>A company should also be careful of fake followers. An influencer can purchase fake followers, making them appear to have a much larger fan base than they actually do. When picking an influencer, first make sure their followers were obtained organically. Although this can be done manually, it is much easier to use a tool that checks for you, such as InstaCheck. The tool is designed to detect fake accounts by analyzing their engagement, spam and overall activity.

We all have in mind internationally successful brands that have been built thanks to the power of social networks, content creators and well-executed Influence Marketing campaigns such as Daniel Wellington or Glossier for example. However, if this strategic lever is still an effective way to develop, increase sales or achieve success, it is only possible if you structure your campaigns well and know all the ins and outs. Here are 5 mistakes to avoid (and to keep in mind) for your next Influence Marketing projects. <br/> <br/> <b>Not defining campaign goal(s) </b><br/>The first and foremost unforgivable mistake when it comes to your Influencer Marketing campaigns is certainly not defining strategic goals for them beforehand. Although this may seem obvious, a surprisingly high number of marketers and professionals forget this crucial step and therefore end up with unsatisfactory performance because they don\u2019t know exactly what they want to achieve from the campaign and are therefore unable to analyse their results effectively.<br/><br/>To set the goals of your Influencer Marketing project, simply ask yourself these questions: what do I want to achieve with this campaign? What are my objectives? Do I want to develop my notoriety, increase my sales, or increase my number of followers to gain legitimacy? Whatever your goals are, define them clearly and write them down somewhere to remember them throughout your Influencer project.<br/><br/>With clearly defined targets, you will be able to plan the different activations needed to achieve them more easily and it will also be easier to measure the performance of your campaigns. Once you have set the objectives you want to achieve, you can define your key performance indicators (KPIs).<br/><br/>If your main goal is, for example, to increase brand awareness, the most important KPIs for you will probably be reach, traffic or engagement. If your objective is to increase conversions, the engagement rate, conversion rate and number of sales will be the most important key performance indicators to follow.<br/><br/>As a reminder, the main objectives of Influencer Marketing are to<br/><br/>> Improve visibility by making your brand, services or products known,<br/><br/>> Increase your conversion rate, your customers and therefore your sales,<br/><br/>> Gaining on notoriety by increasing the number of subscribers on social networks,<br/><br/>> Enhance your brand image to reassure the consumer and show your legitimacy,<br/><br/>Your aims largely determine your Influencer Marketing campaign and each of the choices and actions you will take. It\u2019s therefore important to take the time to clearly define them before jumping in head first. Each of your commercial or marketing activities is created with precise objectives defined before any action is taken. Your Influence Marketing campaigns follow this same principle and should not be an exception to your overall strategy.<br/><br/>  <b>Going for the wrong compensation model</b><br/>One of the biggest mistakes in Influence Marketing is when brands do not offer sufficient compensation to the KOLs they work with. It is therefore imperative that you determine the type and amount of compensation you want to offer content creators from the start.<br/><br/>Depending on the type of KOLs you have identified, different forms of compensation can be considered. While nano and micro-influencers may agree to work with you in exchange for a product offering or an invitation to an experience, KOLs with larger communities will likely require compensation in addition to said product offering or experience. Again, this remuneration can take different forms, you can define a fixed amount for the campaign, or choose the affiliation option or even both in some cases.<br/><br/>Overall, here are the main forms of compensation used today in Influence Marketing campaigns:<br/><br/><b>Pay per Cost</b><br/>Pay per cost is the most common form of remuneration today. It is a model in which you pay a flat fee to content creators to publish a post for your brand.<br/><br/><b>Free products or experiences</b><br/>This is another commonly used model where you offer free products or paid trips to the content creator rather than financial compensation. This model is particularly used for campaigns engaging micro-influencers.<br/><br/><b>Cost per engagement</b><br/>This is a model where you pay the KOL (Key Opinion Leader) an agreed amount based on the number of people who respond to the content published by the content creator.<br/><br/><b>Cost per acquisition</b><br/>Here you offer compensation for sales or subscriptions made by content creators via affiliate marketing for example. If you opt for this form of remuneration, you will have to determine beforehand the percentage of sales that will go to the influencer at the end of the Influence campaign.<br/><br/>Finally, the last mistake frequently made in Influence Marketing concerns the creative freedom given to KOLs (Key Opinion Leaders) in the context of a campaign. It is necessary to have a clear brief of what is expected in the context of the Influence Marketing collaboration, but this brief should not be too restrictive for the content creator. Indeed, if you have selected an influencer rather than another, it is certainly partly because you appreciate their world and what they give off. It is therefore important to let him be creative in the realization of the campaign and the content so that his publications remain authentic and are perceived as such by his audience.<br/><br/>If you restrict the creativity of content creators by imposing strict guidelines or an overly advertising message, you risk greatly reducing the impact of your campaign because the subscribers of the latter, who know him well, will immediately see that it is a sponsored message, a type of publication that is generally viewed with suspicion by the communities.<br/><br/>Putting too many strict instructions on influencers is far from ideal. After all, influencers know their followers very well, so they are more likely to know how to tell them about your brand. Also, if you want to work with a content creator on a long-term basis, it\u2019s important that they feel comfortable working with you, so they\u2019re more likely to create engaging and authentic content.","image":"/images/website/blog_3.svg","created_at":"Oct 21st, 2022","created_by":"Harsh Lamba","tags":["Mistakes"],"tagsColor":"#febf72"},{"id":2,"title":"The importance of Influencers for Retail Businesses","content":"Did you ever wonder why so many brands turn to influencers to help them promote their products? It\u2019s not because it\u2019s the only marketing we have left in this day and age. It\u2019s because it WORKS. <br/> <br/> What we need to remember is that influencer marketing is not a new thing. It\u2019s probably the oldest way of marketing \u2013 word of mouth. The only thing is that it\u2019s \u2018slightly\u2019 changed, and the biggest change comes from brands being able to control at least some part of that word of mouth.<br/><br/>But why are we devoting this article to influencers and retail? It\u2019s because it\u2019s evident that influencers are actually retailers of today. The shift started happening already years ago when instead of going through catalogues, people started looking at social media to find the next thing for themselves, whether in fashion, technology, beauty, fitness, travel or so. But with the social commerce revolution happening and platforms adding shoppable features, the purchases started happening right then and there. <br/><br/>But why does influencer marketing work so well in retail? First of all - people want to talk to people, not businesses and corporations.<br/><br/><b>\u2018Experience\u2019 the product through visual storytelling</b><br/>First and foremost, through social media and influencers, people can \u2018touch and feel\u2019 the product, they can see it on another person, hear about the product features and find out the pros and cons before purchase. On the other hand, people start identifying with the influencers they follow (when it\u2019s a loyal relationship), and when the recommendation pops in, it\u2019s almost like an honest recommendation from a friend.  That\u2019s what triggers purchase, and that\u2019s how retailers make money (of course, influencers make money too ;)).<br/><br/><b>Companies who know the game earn Rs1800 for every Rs100 invested in influencers</b><br/>Brands earn an average of Rs 765 for every Rs1 they invest in influencer marketing. That\u2019s a pretty nice return on investment. But before you start your campaigns, keep in mind that according to Influencer Marketing Hub, brands who are experts in influencer marketing (i.e. know their sh**) earn up to Rs 1800 for each Rs 100 invested. Therefore it\u2019s crucial to start your campaigns right, use the right tools, check your data and make sure your brief is clear. <br/><br/><b>Non-celebrities are who people identify with</b><br/>Before we came to today\u2019s influencers, there were celebrity endorsements. And they did their part in promoting products and brands, as they still do today. But younger generations are looking to hear opinions of someone they can identify with, those \u2018just like them\u2019. Therefore, in today\u2019s social media world, it\u2019s absolutely superficial to just look at the number of followers an influencer has next to their avatar. It\u2019s the engagement that matters. Of course, engagement goes way beyond just one metric, and goes hand in hand with content quality, authenticity, credibility, and charisma. But at the end of the day, it comes down to how much an influencer is able to engage their follower base, and ultimately how does that engagement convert for the brands they work with. And all this data is easily checked for each influencer with tools such as X-Ray Scan.<br/><br/><b>Easy way of finding things you like</b><br/>Instead of scrolling endlessly or roaming through stores, whether online or offline, to find the perfect shoes, handbag or something people didn\u2019t even know they needed, they can now just follow influencers whose style they like or whose style matches their own. They can save time searching for things, or even get inspiration on how to style things, how to use a certain face mask or how a certain gadget can make their life easier. <br/><br/><b>Influencers are known to help drop shipping businesses big time</b><br/>Influencer marketing is not a big brands\u2019 property. On the contrary, it\u2019s useful for those just starting and can help drop shippers get their products out there. Starting out with your drop shipping store might mean your marketing budgets are not as big as you\u2019d wish. For this reason, it\u2019s important to know that influencer marketing offers various payment options, enabling you to pay only for what you get. Performance-based campaigns allow you to track each influencer\u2019s contribution to sales or website traffic and save money on empty promises and fake followers. Also, Post For Rent platform offers various campaign set-up options, as well as a pay-with-a-product option, which is sometimes crucial for drop shippers\u2019 success.  <br/><br/><b>Conclusion: Influencers ARE today\u2019s retailers</b><br/>It\u2019s clear that today\u2019s retail power belongs to influencers, and it\u2019s for various reasons. They serve as a source of discovery for the products people need or don\u2019t even know they need, they are able to test and recommend products before they\u2019re even in store, they can direct you to exact places where you can buy them (and sometimes they include discount codes), and they allow you to save time searching for which product to buy, how to use them, how to style them and much more. And with today\u2019s social commerce innovation, the shopping can happen right there where you see it: on Facebook, Instagram etc. Therefore, it\u2019s definitely worth investing your resources in influencers, but it\u2019s crucial you do it right, by checking your data, perfecting your brief, setting clear objectives and measuring results.","image":"/images/website/blog_2.svg","created_at":"Apr 1st, 2021","created_by":"Harsh Lamba","tags":["Growth"],"tagsColor":"#6bbbfc"},{"id":1,"title":"COVID\u2019s impact on Influencer Marketing","content":"Coronavirus has messed up the arrangement for some organizations. With the pandemic having influenced the worldwide economy, brands have needed to reconsider their whole showcasing techniques and approach something more open to their intended interest group, and this is the place where influencer advertising has had an advantage over different types of conventional promoting. <br/><br/>With tough lockdowns set up confining individuals\' developments, OOH publicizing has endured an extraordinary shot over the most recent few months, forgetting about brands to distinguish elective techniques to reach to expected clients. As an ever increasing number of individuals have relocated to computerized stages as their go-to place to devour content (be it as video, sound or composed substance), on account of the developing number of cell phone clients in the nation just as very economical 4G plans, brands are enthusiastic about utilizing the high commitment and reach of advanced stages through influencers. With more individuals remaining inside because of the lockdown, online media stages have likewise seen a spike in promotion impressions and client commitment. Adding to the way that influencer advertising efforts are unquestionably more adaptable and financially savvy has further fuelled the movement from customary promoting to advanced. Another potential gain of utilizing influencer advertising is the span towards twenty to thirty year olds and Gen Z, a group of people that is more disposed to purchase items through web-based media, be it through influencers with a significant advanced impression, or influencers that oblige explicit specialties for example miniature influencers. <br/><br/>As indicated by the Economic Times, India\'s influencer market is esteemed at $75-150 million every year, with most brands in the nation distributing up to Rs 10 lakh each for their influencer promoting financial plans. In any case, presently, a large portion of the brands the world over are evaluating the monetary effect of the COVID-19 pandemic. Paid sponsorship bargains will evaporate and it is the way of life influencers who will be straightforwardly affected. <br/><br/>The financial stoppage because of COVID-19 has constrained various brands to eliminate their promoting spending plans, which has straightforwardly influenced influencers and their sponsorship bargains. A new report by Socialbakers has uncovered that: <br/><br/>Brands on Instagram working with influencers dropped by 37% in April 2020 contrasted with a year ago, while Instagram influencers utilizing #ad diminished by 30% <br/><br/>Influencer advertising proficiency (the proportion of normal connections on an influencer\'s marked post versus a brand\'s natural post) fell by 40% <br/><br/>Organizations with miniature influencers (>10,000) filled colossally in 2020, as brands made less expensive missions. <br/><br/>Influencer promoting is best for additional little brands, with under 10,000 devotees, and least successful for extra-enormous brands with more than 1,000,000 adherents <br/><br/>Notwithstanding, there is a silver covering that rises out of this report. Yuval Ben-Itzhak, CEO of Socialbakers says: <br/><br/>\\"In spite of the financial effect of COVID-19, brands are as yet putting resources into influencer advertising to arrive at their intended interest groups, however with a particularly extraordinary methodology. Nano and miniature influencers are presently seen as high-esteem assets, bringing high effect without the enormous sticker price of large scale and uber influencers. As financial plans stay tight, shrewd brands will probably keep on extending associations with these more modest influencers as a feature of a more intelligent web-based media procedure in the wake of the proceeding with overall pandemic.\\" <br/><br/>As brands adapt to more tight promoting spending plans, the information shows they are progressively putting resources into influencers with more modest followings. In the course of the most recent 16 months, over 40% of all brand associations were with more modest influencers with between 10,000-50,000 supporters. The following biggest offer, which began filling again in 2020, and pointedly since the pandemic hit, was miniature influencers with less than 10,000 adherents. Uber influencers were engaged with minimal measure of brand associations, at under 3%. <br/><br/>In April 2020, 33.3% of all Instagram influencers helping out brands were nano influencers, and 31.9% of all #ad posts came from nano influencers. That is the most noteworthy those rates have been since June 2019. Of all the brand collaborations that Socialbakers dissected, almost 94% were miniature influencers with less than 100,000 supporters. This focuses to a conviction among brands that positive mission results can be accomplished with more modest, more credible influencers that are nearer to their genuine public. <br/><br/>Coronavirus may have caused a significant interruption in the realm of influencer promoting yet passing by the reports, miniature and nano-influencers were the go-to decisions of influencers for brands to work with for their missions, pointing towards a move in pattern towards influencers who have an after between 10,000 to 50,000.","image":"/images/website/blog_1.svg","created_at":"Dec 23rd,
